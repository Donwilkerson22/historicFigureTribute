                <h3><b>Woodland Park, MI</b></h3> 
                <p>Woodland Park, Michigan was a small resort established by Marion E. Auther, a black Ohio businessman and leading salesman for the Idlewild Resort Company, the same company that developed the much more famous Idlewild.
                    Woodland Park, located in the northwest corner of Newaygo County, was like most black resorts: established to provide a place of rest and relaxation for middle class African Americans.  The Authers hoped to capitalize on this market by selling lots to those who would build homes.
                    The Authers also invested heavily in the community.  They built a structure in 1922 that served multiple purposes over the years.  It was, in turn, a hotel, realty office, community center, church, and on occasion a funeral parlor.  By 1933 the couple renovated the building, converting it into a combination tavern, café, and convenience store.  They called the building Pine Cone Tavern.

                <h3><b>Idlewild, MI</b></h3> 
                <p>Idlewild, Michigan, was one of the leading African American resorts in the era of Jim Crow segregation. Although founded in 1912, resort property sales lagged until Dr. Daniel Hale Williams, the leading black surgeon at the time, became the first famous property owner in 1915.  Williams retired at Idlewild and died there in 1931. 
                   His presence attracted colleagues and associates from Chicago, and eventually prominent black doctors from other Midwestern cities began purchasing property there.
                   Prominent African Americans, including Dr. W.E.B. DuBois, author Charles Waddell Chesnutt, millionaire businesswoman Madam C.J. Walker, and Chicago attorney Violette Nealey Anderson purchased Idlewild property.  
                   the resort also attracted leading entertainers who made it the “Summer Apollo of Michigan”, hosting entertainers such as Della Reese, The Four Tops, Jackie Wilson, Brook Benton, Dinah Washington, Etta James, Aretha Franklin, and George Kirby
                   By the 1950s and early 1960s, Idlewild reached the height of its popularity.  During those years nearly 25,000 vacationers made their way to the community, temporarily overwhelmingly the permanent year-round population.  During this era, Idlewild boasted more than 300 black-owned businesses.

                <p>
                    Idlewild & Woodland Park, like other all-black resorts, would not survive the civil rights movement.  As formerly whites-only clubs and resorts across the nation integrated in the late 1960s, Idlewild went into decline.  Its clubs and hotels closed as blacks began to frequent other resorts. Today, Idlewild is a struggling retirement community with fewer than half a dozen businesses.  Despite this decline, Idlewild symbolized the heyday of the combination of race, leisure, and geography to create a briefly prosperous community through niche tourism.
